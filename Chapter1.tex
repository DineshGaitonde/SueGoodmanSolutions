\subsection*{Exercise 1.1.3}
If the complement of a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is open, 
then $A$ is closed.

Consider a limit point $a$ of $A$. Assume $a \notin A$. So it is in
$A^c$, the complement of $A$. But $A^c$ is open. So I can create an open
set around $a$ completely contained in $A^c$. Since all the points in the
set so created are in $A^c$, none of them are in $A$. Hence $a$ is not a
limit point of $A$ contradicting our assumption that $a \notin A$. Hence
we have shown that all limit points of $A$ are contained in $A$. Hence
$A$ is closed.
